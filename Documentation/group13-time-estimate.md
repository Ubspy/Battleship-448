# Group 13 Time Estimate

We did not use any formal methods described in class to arrive at this time estimate; we simply divided the project into smaller pieces for individuals to complete, and estimated the amount of time for each of those pieces, considering development, testing, and debugging.

1. Changing base code to meet baseline implementation requirements (TBD)
    1. TBD, 1-5 hours most likely
    1. Andrew R
1. AI Implementation (13 to 17 hours)
    1. Placing ships randomly
        1. 1 hours
        1. Andrew Riachi
    1. Easy mode (random moves from AI)
        1. 1 hours
        1. Jack Moren
    1. Medium mode (random moves until it hits a ship, then fire on adjacent squares)
        1. 3 hours
        1. Jack Moren
    1. Hard mode (cheats)
        1. 3 hours
