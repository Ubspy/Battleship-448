<div class="description">
    endGame() takes winner to display the winner of the game. When endGame() is called it first disables 
any further click events to register. After that, restoreShips() is called on the current player’s turn
so each player can see the opponents ship placements. Next, both the start-game and end-game buttons are
disables to prevent further blacking out of the screen. Finally, a window alert is called to display the 
winner of the game for both players to see.

    hideShips takes in current player turn as a parameter then checks if player one or player two is 
currently up. If it is player-one’s turn then player-two’s ships must be hidden for the incoming shot 
made by player one. So, hideShips checks each cell to see of player-two's board for any grey colored 
cells. If a cell is grey, or a cell with a ship object, then it will be set to transparent to effectively hide the 
ships while maintaining the hits and misses. If the current player's turn is equal to 2 it will hide player-one's ships.

<div class="description">
    startGame takes in the user input shipCount to initialize the number of ships that will need to be 
placed by each player. Next, startGame() disables both the start turn and end turn buttons to avoid a 
turn switch before all ships have been placed by the player. After that, the click event is called and if 
current turn is 1, then player one can click a cell to choose a head location of the first ship. If the 
placement is valid then a new ship object is created to be inserted into the cell. After the cell detects a 
ship object it is colored gray. If the ship object is greater than length 1, then the user will be prompted 
to click any of the possible tail locations to orient the ship. A check is put in place that disallows the 
user to click any other cells until a viable tail is selected. After a head and tail location are selected the 
entire space between them is colored gray to indicate the location of the player's ship. If there are no 
more ships to be placed by player one, then end turn can be pressed and the next player can begin the 
same process of placing ships. After all ships by both players are placed, player-one's shooting phase 
begins and a shotRow and shotColum on player-two’s board can be selected by player one. 
attemptedShot() is called and if shotRow and shotColumn have a ship object stored in that location 
then a hit is declared, and the cell is colored red. If a hit is declared, then allSunk() is called to check 
if the player has sunk all the opponent's ships and won the game. If no winner is decided yet, then the 
next player begins the same process of clicking on a shotRow and shotColumn.  If there is no ship 
object in that location then the shot is declared as a miss and the cell is colored blue.

    When this function is called it first checks what value currentTurn holds, either 1 or 2 for player one and player two. 
Then the function sets the Boolean value hasShot to false because each turn switch will require the player to shoot again.
